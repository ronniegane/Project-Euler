# Project-Euler
Scripts for solving problems from http://projecteuler.net

To quote from the About section:

##What is Project Euler?

*"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.*

*The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context."*

###Languages
My scripts are mostly written for python 3.4.3 (I will note if I use different languages)
